# Employee-Attrition
In my current workplace - food industry - one of my first tasks was to analyze employee turnover. I created lots of tables and graphs, and we drew several conclusions from that analysis.

At the time, and ever since, this question was of central importance.

Now I have a dataset from Kaggle, I will analyze it and predict whether an employee will leave the company in the future or not.
